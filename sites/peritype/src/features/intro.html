<p>
  Python's typing system has been evolving for many years, introducing new
  features and syntaxes. Everything is available at runtime through the typing
  module, but navigating and manipulating these types can be a challenge.

<p>
  Peritype offers a simple interface to inspect and work with Python types at
  runtime. You can easily inspect generic parameters, attribute type hints and
  method signatures of any type.
